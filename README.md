# gaystate
A Twitter bot that tweets all the state names of the United States with the word 'gay' before them.

Set `CONSUMER_KEY`, `CONSUMER_SECRET`, `ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY`, and `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`
in your environment. Run `bot.py`. Or use the `Dockerfile` to make a container which
will do same.

Get the credentials by creating a Twitter application and completing an access token
request out of band, such as by using a pin, or through whatever other murderously
difficult procedure you can extract after a labyrinthine walk through the Twitter
developer documentation.
